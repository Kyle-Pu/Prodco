# Producer Consumer

A solution to the producer-consumer (bounded buffer) problem using semaphores in C.

## Building

Clone this repository and run `make` in the repo's directory.

Aside: [This](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile#:~:text=The%20make%20utility%20requires%20a,be%20installed%20using%20make%20install%20.) is a good site to learn about Makefiles.

## Plans

1) Random simulation and visualization at first
2) Let user choose when to produce and when to consume, as well as how many items to produce/consume.
