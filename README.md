# Producer Consumer

A solution to the producer-consumer (bounded buffer) problem using semaphores in C.

## Building

Clone this repository and run `make` in the repo's directory.

## Plans

1) Random simulation and visualization at first
2) Let user choose when to produce and when to consume, as well as how many items to produce/consume.
